# SST-Fire-NoFire-Image-Classification

We have chosen pre-trained Image Classification Model - VGG16. We did not chose Object Detection Model since it is a binary problem that doesn't need the exact location of fire. The code is .ipynb file, it was easy to use for collaboration of our team.

VGG16 is a type of CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) that is considered to be one of the best computer vision models to date.
